## Background

Congratulations on your new job! As the new lead analyst for the [New York Citi Bike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Bike) Program, you are now responsible for overseeing the largest bike-sharing program in the United States. In your new role, you will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.

Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

## Questions Answered

The following are some of questions answered. 

* How many trips have been recorded in total during the chosen period?

* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are the top locations?

* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? Based on data, why?

* Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? Based on data, why?

* Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? Based on data, why?

* How many trip are recorded  by Ride Type?

* What is the Ride Type Preference for a bike trip?


2. Used  visualizations to design a dashboard for each phenomenon. The dashboards should be accompanied by an analysis explaining why the phenomenon may be occurring. 

3. Created the following visualizations for city officials:

* A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey, with zip code data overlaid on top.


4. Created  final presentation.

    * Create a Tableau story that brings together the visualizations, requested maps, and dashboards.

    * Ensure your presentation is professional, logical, and visually appealing.
